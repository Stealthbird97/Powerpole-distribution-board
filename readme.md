# DC Distribution board for Anderson power-pole connectors.

This project is a fused DC distribution board.
The design uses Anderson powerpoles and ATC/ATO fuses which are in common use in amateur radio.
Unlike other DIY solutions this uses the powerpole 45A PCB contacts rather than short stubs of solid wire crimped to the powerpoles.

## Construction notes

* PCB should be made on a 2oz copper board.
